# WallStreetBets Stock Portfolio

This is a web application that identifies and analyzes trending stocks on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and their sentiment using NLP analysis to generate a stock portfolio. Unfortunately, changes to the Reddit third-party API has resulted in me having to shut this application down. Before shutting down, returns of over 1% were seen on average on a monthly basis.
